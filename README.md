Never forget to drink water again! Hydration Buddy sends gentle reminders every 25 minutes so you can stay refreshed and focused throughout your day.

# Why I Built It
I noticed I was often dehydrated during long work sessions, which affected my energy and concentration. This extension is my personal solution to stay on track and keep hydrated regularly without breaking focus.

2. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/
3. Enable Developer mode (top right)
4. Click Load unpacked and select the project folder
5. The extension will start sending hydration reminders every 20 minutes automatically

# Customization
The reminder interval is currently set to 25 minutes, but you can easily adjust the timing in the code if you prefer.
